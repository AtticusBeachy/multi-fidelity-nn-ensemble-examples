# multi-fidelity-nn-ensemble-examples
Numerical examples for an upcoming Journal paper

These codes can be used to replicate the numerical examples in an upcoming Journal paper (link to be added after publication). Results will differ somewhat based on random sample initializations, randomness in the neural network initializations, and randomness in the optimizers.
